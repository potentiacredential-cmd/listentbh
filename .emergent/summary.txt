The AI engineer successfully built the Daily Mood Compass, later rebranded to listentbh, an MVP for emotional wellness. The work progressed iteratively, starting with core features and gradually adding complexity. Key milestones included implementing the Emotional Listener with Claude Sonnet 4, robust crisis detection, and a human-like texting interface. Memory processing, multi-agent integration (Pattern Analyzer, Insight Synthesizer), and comprehensive user authentication with Google Sign-in were also integrated. The engineer focused on a calming UI, adhered to detailed design guidelines, and meticulously addressed bugs, including a session summary routing issue and authentication errors. QA testing was performed, identifying a critical bug with the chat send button, which is the immediate focus. The engineer followed all system constraints, including specific URL/port rules and third-party integration protocols.

<product_requirements>
The project's goal is to build Daily Mood Compass (rebranded to listentbh), an empathetic, non-judgmental multi-agent system for daily emotional check-ins.
**Core Objectives:** Provide safe emotional processing, immediate validation, identify emotional patterns, avoid clinical advice/hallucination, maintain human-like interactions, and prioritize user privacy.
**Agents:**
1.  **Emotional Listener:** Primary conversational interface for daily check-ins.
2.  **Pattern Analyzer:** Background intelligence for tracking emotional states and identifying recurring patterns (e.g., time-based, situational triggers).
3.  **Insight Synthesizer:** Creates gentle, actionable weekly summaries based on Pattern Analyzer data.
4.  **Safety Monitor:** Detects crisis indicators and triggers escalation protocols, ensures ethical boundaries.
5.  **Memory Processing Guide:** (Later added) Guides users through emotional reconsolidation (Externalize, Reframe, Distance, Release) using neuroscience-backed techniques.
6.  **Wellness Score Calculator:** (Requested, not implemented) Analyze data for 5 wellness scores (Stress, Emotional Well-being, Focus & Clarity, Anxiety, Confidence & Security).
**UI Specifications:** Calming, minimalist design with pastel colors and soft gradients. Chat-style interface with typing indicators, message timestamps, and smooth animations. Dashboard for weekly insights. Instagram-worthy visual scores (requested).
**Technical Requirements:** React frontend, FastAPI backend, MongoDB database. Secure, encrypted data storage. Use  for LLM (Anthropic Claude Sonnet 4) and . Google OAuth for authentication. Strict adherence to URL/port configuration, no hardcoding.

<current_work>
The immediate work revolves around a critical bug reported by the user: the send button in conversational texting is not working after logging in. The AI engineer has just reviewed the  file, specifically the  function and the associated button, to diagnose why messages are not being sent or processed when the user attempts to interact with the AI after a successful login. This indicates an issue in the message sending mechanism or its interaction with the authenticated state. Previous fixes involved backend authentication and session handling, but this new bug points to a frontend interaction problem that needs to be addressed for core functionality.
</current_work>

<optional_next_step>
The next step is to debug and fix the send button not working issue in  to restore conversational functionality.
